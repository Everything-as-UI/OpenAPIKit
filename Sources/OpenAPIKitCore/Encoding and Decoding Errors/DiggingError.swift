/// A `DiggingError` is an error that knows how to dig deeper into its
/// underlying context to attempt to pull out a more granular reason for the
/// failure.
///
/// This is a relevant concept with respect to `DecodingError`s in particular
/// because they often have underlying causes.
///

    /// branch in search of a more granular error.

    /// If an `Either` fails to decode and the most useful error for the user is just
    /// that neither option of the `Either` was found, then this function returns `nil`
    /// which indicates neither branch should be dug into.

    /// On the other hand, one of the two branches of the `Either` might have failed to decode
    /// trivially (i.e. the user does not need to know that both branches failed because one
    /// of those branches is very unlikely to have been the intended one). If that happens, it is
    /// more useful to dig into the less trivial branch and display a more granular error to the user
    /// from deeper in that brach. When this occurs, this function retruns the udnerlying error on
    /// that branch.
